      "Title": "Problem 1",
      "Text": "<p>The text provides three primary wave – strategic approaches (differentiation, cost, and response) – for achieving competitive advantage. Provide and example of each not given in the text. Support your choices. <em>(Hint: Note the examples provided in the text.)</em></p>\r\n",
      "MinCharacters": 50,
      "Answer": "<p>The three methods are cost leadership, differentiation, and response. Cost leadership can be illustrated by Walmart, with low overhead and huge buying power to pressure its suppliers into concessions. Differentiation can be illustrated by almost any restaurant or restaurant chain, such as Red Lobster, which offers a distinct menu and style of service than others. Response can be illustrated by a courier service such as FedEx, that guarantees specific delivery schedules; or by a custom tailor, who will hand make a suit specifically for the customer.</p>",

      "Title": "Problem 2",
      "Text": "<p>Within the food service industry (restaurants that serve meals to customers, but not just fast food), find examples of firms that have sustained competitive advantage by competing on the basis of (1) cost leadership, (2) response, and (3) differentiation. Cite one example in each category; provide a sentence or two in support of each choice. Do not use fast-food chains for all categories. (Hint: A '99¢ menu' is very easily copied and is not a good source of sustained advantage.)</p>\r\n",
      "MinCharacters": 50,
      "Answer": "<p>Cost leadership: institutional food services, such as Sodexho, provide meal service to college campuses and similar institutions. Such firms often get their contracts by being low bidder to provide service. Response: a catering firm (the customer picks the menu, time, and date). Differentiation: virtually all restaurants seek differentiation in menu, in taste, in service. This is particularly true of fine dining restaurants, but also true of fast food restaurants. For instance, Burger King likes to talk about meals “anyway you want them,” and McDonald’s has a playground or seating area for children.</p>",
