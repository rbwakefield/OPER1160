			<p class="lead"> It is important to realize that companies use various operational strategies to realize their goal of expanding internationally.</p>

			<p>These multinational corporation firms (MNC) are major players on a global basis. They want to grow their sales of products or services and here we look at how they use different operational strategies to achieve this. We will examine four different global strategy options for operations <em>(Lopers et al., 2016, p. 51)</em>. They are: International, Multi-domestic, Global or Transnational. We’ll look at each one in relationship to two axis.</p> 
			
			<p>A matrix diagrams are an excellent way to illustrate two dimensional concepts. The X-axis (across the bottom) is the degree of Local Responsiveness. This could be either of two of the competitive strategies — <strong>quick response and/or differentiation</strong>. The Y axis looks at the other competitive advantage – <strong>cost reduction considerations or global efficiency</strong>. Low would mean efficiencies or cost reductions are not as important to succeed whereas companies in either of the top two quadrants would have large pressures on them to reduce costs. Practice drawing a matrix and placing the strategies in the corresponding quadrants as we explain each of the strategies.</p> 
			
			<p>The operations managers need to understand which competitive strategy a company is pursuing to effectively set up the operations for international expansion.</p>

			<p>This type of strategy means the company is <em>not</em> really using an international strategy for expansion as they have instead chosen to maintain a globally centralized organization focused on the home markets but selling excess internationally. They maintain a centralized head office and produce the same product for all markets. They use exports or licensing of their products from the home country. (e.g. Harley Davidson Motorcycles or the licensing of Disney’s Mickey Mouse) In other cases, the required capital investment is so large that they can’t afford other plants in other countries (e.g. steel manufacturing plants) so they produce and export.</p>

			<p>"What's for dinner?" is a question of interest to folks of all nations.</p>
			
			<p>The answer depends, in some part, on the international strategy of the corporations that provide foods, drinks, and condiments worldwide. Firms choose between the potential trade-offs between efficiency in production/distribution and responsiveness to local market preferences. Below, we provide examples of how a firm's decisions may provide some answers to how you might fill your belly.</p>
			
			<h3 class="text-core-2">Multi-domestic Strategy</h3>
			
			<p>This type of company uses the same model globally but sacrifices some operational efficiencies like economies of scale to instead emphasize responsiveness to local tastes and requirements. You’ll find franchising or joint ventures are often used to expand with this strategy. They are being competitive by being responsive to customer locations and their desires.</p>

			        <p class="white-text mb-0">High focus on <strong>Local Responsiveness</strong> for quick response or differentiation to meet local tastes.</p>
			        <p class="white-text mb-0">The need for <strong>Cost Reduction</strong> is low…people are willing to pay for the brand or product.</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<h3 class="text-core-2">Global Strategy</h3>
			
			<p>With this strategy, the company treats the world as largely one market with little local variation. This strategy allows the global growth of sales of products or services by selling the same products everywhere allowing lower prices because of the economies of scale or being able to take advantage of lower wages and/or less stringent rules and regulations in foreign locations. Often, the customers are other businesses (B2B sales) where low cost value is important but product features or branding is less responsive to customers’ needs.</p>

			    <div class="card-body">
			        <p class="white-text mb-0">Low focus on <strong>Local Responsiveness</strong> with standardized products.</p>
			        <p class="white-text mb-0"><strong>High Cost Reduction</strong> in manufacturing due to fierce competition</p>
			    </div>
			</div>

			<h3 class="text-core-2">Transnational Strategy</h3>
			
			<p>This strategy is open to changing products and/or services and service levels for local customers as well as working hard to keep costs and therefore prices competitive. They are not controlled by head office nor are they only focused on their own countries. Instead, this strategy means a company is considered a “world company” with a vast, sophisticated interdependent network of worldwide operations. They balance the desire for cost efficiencies with the need to vary preferences across countries. Nestle is a good example of such a company. Although Swiss based, Nestle has 447 factories in 86 countries with 98% of its sales made outside Switzerland where some products are available worldwide while others are only sold in select markets <em>(Lopers et al., 2016, p. 52)</em>. This strategy tends to match products to countries but doesn’t alter the brand or name of the products. For instance, Coca-Cola is a worldwide brand but it does taste different in different countries. Nestle’s Coffee Crisp Chocolate Bars and Smarties are not available in the USA. Companies utilizing this strategy are really utilizing all three of the competitive strategies—a demanding international strategy to operationalize.</p>
