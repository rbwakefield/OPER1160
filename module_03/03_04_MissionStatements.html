			<p>First, a company has to conduct a SWOT analysis to know the Internal Strengths and Weaknesses and the External Opportunities and Threats. The idea is to maximize or leverage the strengths and opportunities and minimize the threats and weaknesses. Knowing this, a firm then needs to set or assess its corporate mission and missions for its functional areas. Then strategies are needed to achieve the mission of the company and functional areas. These strategies need to be frequently re-examined to ensure they fit with the changing business environment.</p>
			
			<p>Once the Mission is clear, Strategies need to be set at each level so action plans can be set in motion to achieve a competitive advantage over competitors. Although managers might approach them in some combination, the three strategy approaches to achieve competitive advantages through Operations are via <strong>differentiation, low cost leadership and responsive</strong>.</p>

			<h3 class="text-core-2">Competing on differentiation</h3>
			
			<p>If competing on differentiation or uniqueness, companies will provide its products or services in ways to deliver more value to a customer. For products it might be product features, or services provided with the product. Such services for products might be through the convenience of the setup/installation, or product delivery, training or repair and maintenance services. For services, one way is creating an experience. Think of how Disney provides an experience at The Magic Kingdom or theme restaurants like the Hard Rock Café engages the customer to provide so much more than just food at a restaurant. </p>

				<p><strong>You can’t be the best, at the cheapest price, and be the fastest… you need to choose your strategy.</strong></p>

			<h3 class="text-core-2">Competing on cost leadership</h3>
			
			<p>This is providing lower costs while achieving maximum value as defined by the customer. Porter Airlines advertise “quicker check-ins with shorter lines” and “faster gate access through our airport” (Porter, 2017) and they provide free newspapers, snacks, and Wi-Fi and lounges that are open to all passengers. So, they are providing operational efficiencies to reduce costs and yet are viewed as having value add-ons.</p>
			
			<p>Walmart is probably the best known for utilizing this strategy. Even their store brand is “Great Value” and their tagline is “Save Money. Live Better”. They have driven down overhead costs, increased their inventory turnover while offering a broad selection of good quality items in stores often open 24-hours daily for customer convenience. These operational strategies have made them a low-cost leader.</p>
			
			<h3 class="text-core-2">Competing on response</h3>
			
			<p>This strategy means delivering a full range of values for customers including rapid, flexible and reliable performance. <strong>Rapid</strong> response or quickness might be lunch in less than 15 minutes or Amazon Prime Shipping. <strong>Flexible</strong> response might be the ability to change to meet customers’ needs like adapting toppings on a burger at Harvey’s or being open hours more convenient for customers. <strong>Reliability</strong> of scheduling is also a way to gain a competitive advantage. Think of FedEx’s early slogan “absolutely, positively on time”. If a customer can count on a delivery, that’s worth a lot. That’s a competitive advantage.</p>
			
			<p>Companies in the same industry can each focus on their own mission and make strategy decisions focusing on a different competitive advantage strategy (differentiation, value leadership or responsiveness). Chapter 2, <em>"Example 1 - Strategy Development"</em> <em>(Lopers et al., 2016, p. 45)</em> is a terrific example to work through to see how the external environment was considered, a mission was set and a competitive strategy (differentiation) was selected.</p>
