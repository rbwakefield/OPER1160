			<p>Ancient civilizations developed systems to record inventories, loans, taxes and business transactions. Think of the planning and organizing that went into large projects like the construction of the pyramids. In more recent history, think about your last visit to a pioneer museum.  Remember the broom maker, or the blacksmith or the cooper who made barrels?  Items were crafted and sold locally from these independent shops. Now, today we have computerized production. Next, we will look at the different stages in the history of Operations Management. <em>(Lopers, Wilson, Hill, 2017, p. 11)</em></p>

			          <p>The first stage of significant events we’ll call “Cost Focus”, marked significant changes in operations.</p>

			        <div class="timeline-body">
				        
				        <p class="text-accent-1">Early Concepts (1776 – 1880)</p>
			
						<p>Charles Babbage is famous for promoting Labour Specialization.  He wrote in his “Economy of Machinery” that there were commercial advantages if you carefully divided up labour.  He pointed out that skilled labourers should only be assigned the high-skill tasks and restrict other tasks to lower-skilled and thus lower-paid workers. <em>(Wikipedia, 2017)</em></p>
						
						<p>Eli Whitney(1800) popularized the concept of interchangeable parts when he produced 10,000 muskets for the U.S. government that could be fixed with standardized parts.  Up until then, each gun was considered a special order meaning parts were for specific guns and could not be interchanged (Wikipedia, Interchangeable parts, 2017). This was the beginning of the mass production of parts to assemble final products.</p>
			
				        <p class="text-accent-1">Scientific Management  (1880 – 1910)</p>
			
						<p>During this time period more effort was put into planning and improving productivity.  Henry Gantt created Gantt charts to illustrate project schedules.  Frederick Taylor was an early promoter of business process management.  He advocated for time and motion studies to ensure labour was optimized.  Frank and Lillian Gilbreth were famous for doing time-motion studies to improve efficiency.</p>
			
				        <p class="text-accent-1">Mass Production Era (1910 – 1980)</p>
			
						<p>Then, mass production came into vogue.  Mass production makes many copies of products, very quickly, using assembly line techniques.  Assembly lines were revolutionary with cars moving to the men instead of the men moving to the cars. It revolutionized the world.</p>

			            </div>
			        </div>			
						
						<p>Statistical sampling, economic order quantity calculations, PERT charts and Material Requirement Planning (MRP) all contributed to this revolutionary time.</p>
			
				        <p class="text-accent-1">Rise of Japanese Quality (1950 – 1980)</p>
			
						<p>In the latter part of this period, North America was concentrating on mass production but Japan, rising from the ashes of war, focused on quality.  Their rise to high levels of quality and productivity with low costs created a push to the next stage for North America.</p>

				        <p class="text-accent-1">Lean Production Era (1980 – 1995)</p>
			
						<p>The second major stage was a “Quality Focus”.  It wasn’t until this stage that quality from the eyes of the customer became the focus.</p>
							
						<p>It was in this era that Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Just-in-Time (JIT) and Total Quality Management (TQM) became the operations focus.  Statistics and sampling with continuous improvement was now important.  Dr. Deming and his 14 Points for Management, Toyota’s Kanban or inventory-control systems to control the supply chain and achieve JIT became the new operations methods.  Then, more computerization changed operations again.</p>

				        <p class="text-accent-1">Mass Customization Era (1995 – present)</p>
			
						<p>In this third stage with a “Customization Focus”, operations built on the quality foundation and the need to provide outstanding service to customer leveraged the new computer power.</p>
							
						<p>Now companies are focused on creating the greatest customer-unique value at the lowest possible costs.  Globalization allows companies to seek out new markets and manufacturing cost-savings.  The internet/ecommerce has exploded the possibilities for all stages of the supply chain.</p>
						
						<p>The Triple Bottom Line (People, Planet and Profits) where companies voluntarily focus on the principle that corporate success and social well-being are now strategies and practices that need to be followed by all areas of a business.</p>

			          <p>Operations Managers will continue to be challenged with new technology, global supply chains and sustainability.  The use of information and technology in building smarter and scalable operations seems to becoming more prominent.  Big-data, agile systems, and self-driving (delivery?) vehicles are certainly in the news.  But the trend seems to be “the right product, in the right place at the right time”. Digital Supply Networks (DSN) that unite physical flows, information and finance may allow this.</p>
