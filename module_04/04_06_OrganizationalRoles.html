			<p class="lead">In each of the five phases it is important to remember that all of the different areas of the company need to be involved to maximize the success of the product and/or service.</p>
			
			<p>Without marketing’s input how would we know what customers really want or projected sales?  Without purchasing how could we ensure we get the right suppliers with the right products.  Without accounting, how would we ensure we get the costs correct and know if we can be profitable with this new development. Without operations and supply chain personnel how would we get the prototypes, raw materials, warehousing, manufacturing or shipping completed?</p>
			
			<h3>Some concepts to improve product design and development</h3>
			
			<h4 class="text-core-4">Sequential development versus concurrent engineering</h4>
			
			<p>The development model we’ve been examining is laid out sequentially. It appears each stage is completed then handed to the next phase—in sequence as shown here in <em>Figure 4</em>. This <strong>sequential development process</strong> model is extremely effective when a huge investment is required or safety is of the highest priority. Think of building space ships at NASA or nuclear reactors. It can be effective but very slow.</p>

			</div>
			
			<p>An alternative that is common to bring a product to market quickly is called <strong>concurrent engineering</strong> which allows the activities in the various stages to overlap with one another. See Figure 5 to see how the  For example, they might be designing and building prototypes but still brainstorming some features or searching out some materials or solutions.  The different areas have agreed on the principal characteristics and then work together to bring a new product or service to market quicker than the more consuming, step-by-step sequential model.</p>

					                <p>The involvement of suppliers can vary widely too during these processes. In a <strong>Black Box Design</strong> mode, suppliers are given the specifications and needs and work independently to create the needed components.  They probably have a high-level of specialization and sometimes, they don’t want outside companies involved as they have patented methods or equipment they want to keep to themselves. With <strong>Gray Box Design</strong> methodology, the supplier and original company work together to produce the required components.</p>

					                <p>When designing a new product, components should be standardized between different models and products to reduce the number of different parts required to be inventoried.  It will also mean less quality testing of parts and training of personnel on how to install or use the products. For instance, different cars are built on base chassis.</p>
					                
					                <p>In service, it is also important to standardize the delivery of the service.  For instance, think of the premeasured shots of cream at your local Tim Horton’s for the different sizes of coffees, the premeasured scoops of french fries at McDonalds or the checklist for completion of an oil change at your local shop.</p>

					                <p>Another way to improve products and services is to break components into sections or modules that can be assembled in different ways.  Think of ordering the pieces of furniture to furnish a room or build a wall unit.  IKEA would be a good example of modular designs. Or, at a spa where you can choose different services for a relaxing day.</p>

					                <p>Also called “design to costs” is done in the initial stages of the new product development process.  When designing a product, this requires they look at the functionality and quality and see if it can be developed at a target cost that will still allow a selling price and desired profit margin.  If a product cannot be developed within these guidelines it will not advance through the development process.</p>

A company, especially one competing on low cost value needs to select the best value alternative in the design, materials, and processes.</p>
