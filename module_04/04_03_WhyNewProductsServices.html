			<p class="lead">There are four reasons we develop new products or services <em>(Lopers et al., 2016, p. 63)</em>.</p>
			
			<p>We’ll go through each of these in detail.</p>

				            <h3>External Focus</h3>
				            
			                <p class="white-text">Remember in our last unit where we discussed three ways to gain a competitive advantage and increased sales?</p>
			                
			                <p class="white-text"><strong>Differentiation</strong> - look at President Choice’s wide range of new products, or all the varieties of Tide liquids and tablets…they are continuously introducing the “newest” to beat the competitors.</p>
			                
			                <p class="white-text"><strong>Low Cost Leadership</strong> - look at new phones, computers, or new vehicle features with little to no price changes.</p>
			                
			                <p class="white-text"><strong>Responsiveness</strong> - look at Toyota which brings out new models in under 2 years where the industry standard is 3 years.  Or, a company brings out a new service that allows easier, quicker or more reliable service—Amazon Prime or Loblaws’ Click and Collect online grocery shopping.</p>

				            <h3 class="white-text">Internal Focus</h3>
				            
			                <p class="white-text">Often a company brings out a new product so they can use existing processes more efficiently and effectively.  For example, a company might bring out a new product similar to an existing one to fill up excess capacity and increase the learning curve to translate into cost savings, take advantage of new internal improvements, or change materials (i.e. to recycled raw materials) to save costs or increase customer satisfaction.</p>
			                
			                <p class="white-text">An example of taking advantage of new internal improvements might be how CIBC ATMs no longer require costly envelopes for deposits or you can email yourself a paperless transaction receipt?

			                <p class="white-text">Honda is well known for producing gas powered engines and it has expanded its product lines. They produce everything from cars to motorcycles, to lawnmowers to outboard engines all based on their strength or core competency of producing superior gas engines.</p>

			                <p class="white-text">This set of pictures in Figure 2 shows the broad range of products Honda produces.</p>

				            <h3 class="white-text">Block competitors</h3>
				            
			                <p class="white-text">Sometimes companies introduce a new product or service to ensure customers use their refills or products.  For instance, Apple has its own type of charger and operating system.    Another example, that somewhat backfired, was from the Keurig coffee pot producer.  When they brought out their new version of coffeemaker they added a barcode reading requirement that meant only their own brand of refills could be used. Buyers couldn’t even use their home brew k-cup. They were trying to block competitors and force consumers to buy its brand of coffee pods.  Instead, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/5/7986327/keurigs-attempt-to-drm-its-coffee-cups-totally-backfired" target="_blank" class="dark-grey-text">consumers retaliated <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and stopped buying its brand and posted “workarounds” for the barcoding for the pods.</p>
			                
			                <p class="white-text">An example of a service would be Royal Caribbean’s development of Cococay Beach and only their cruise ships can use it.  Or, in Alaska, Princess Tours and Holland have their own rail cars and hotels just for their landtour guests.

			<h3>New products or services don’t always succeed</h3>
			
			<p>New products or services launched in the marketplace often fail to succeed.  Have you ever read of a product that did its job well but it turned out that no one wanted or needed it or didn’t want to pay for the solution that was provided. It just didn’t fit the market. Remember coloured ketchup, Edsel cars, Orbitz drinks or the New Coke? <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-product-flops-in-history-2016-12/#1957-ford-edsel-1" target="_blank">This article (Gilbert, 2016) <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is a great recap of some of the biggest product flops.</p>
