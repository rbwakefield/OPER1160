			<p class="lead">In our last two units we covered the entire supply chain and a common quote today attributed to the CIO of Nortel is <em class="text-secondary">“Companies don’t compete; supply chains compete”.</em></p>
			
			<p>Logistics is one important cog in that supply chain competition (<em>Littleson, 2008</em>).</p>

			<p>As companies move to access suppliers and resources from around the world, the processes and systems to transport, warehouse, package, and deliver goods and services to customers, has become a complex operation in the global supply chain. It is also an area in a company that is overlooked—unless it goes wrong!</p>
			
			<p>The Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) a worldwide professional association of supply chain management professionals, defines logistics as <em class="text-secondary">“that part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet customers’ requirements.”</em> (C<em>SCMP, 2016</em>)</p>
			
			<p>It is often a candidate for outsourcing as it can be very complex.  Third party logistics providers (3PL) are often hired to execute logistics activities like importing or exporting.  Today, more companies are leaning to fourth-party logistics (4PL) companies which builds on 3PL competencies of various companies and essentially take on the responsibility of building and running the entire supply chain for its customers. (LogisticsDegree.net, n.d.)</p>
			
			<p>With the large investment requirements for shipping fleets, warehousing and technology running the vast informational networks on vast interconnected, moving parts, logistics is important to help companies avoid wasting time, materials and ultimately profits.</p>
			
			<p>Logistics is facing many challenges and opportunities in today’s world including:</p>
