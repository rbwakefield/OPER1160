			<h2 class="text-core-3">Exercise: Inventories vary depending on their usage</h2>
			
			<p class="lead">Imagine we have two separate divisions of a company with two very different requirements for inventories.</p>

			<p>Read these descriptions then jot down three characteristics for each of the two companies’ inventories.</p>

			<h3 class="text-core-4">GM HD Truck – Manufacturing</h3>
			
			<p>GM manufactures new model HD trucks at a rate of 2,000 per day at its one factory.  The factory has approximately 59,000 different parts used each model year and the company works hard to keep inventory on the line at a minimum allowing it to keep 1-2 days stock onhand for larger components and approximately 10 days for smaller nuts, bolts, wiring harnesses, etc.  These trucks are all ordered by dealers before they are manufactured on the line.</p>
			
			<h3 class="text-core-4">GM Parts Distribution Centre (PDC)- Woodstock</h3>
			
			<p>GM has approximately 1,000,000 different part numbers they track to help service vehicles.  They can supply dealerships through its vast network of PDCs throughout North America.</p> 
			
			<p>The GM PDC in Woodstock carries approximately 350,000 different part numbers and services Ontario dealers through a network of common and dedicated carriers.  In addition, they use rail, truck and air to ship to smaller PDCs across Canada.  Their focus is to provide service parts—parts to repair vehicles, of all ages, of all GM makes and models and model years, to GM dealerships.  Inventory turns for Woodstock warehouse would be approximately 3Xs per year.</p>

				   <td>Turns are high…if manufacturing is 250 days per year and 1-2 days of stock, turns are 125 – 250 times per year for main components and 25 turns (10 days) for smaller stock</td>
				   <td>Turns on the overall stock is 3xs per year but there will be various categories (ABC) that turn at different rates</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				   <td>Calculated from orders from dealers therefore Dependent Demand</td>
				   <td>Forecasting, therefore Independent demand as not sure when a vehicle will fail or when a part will be ordered</td>
				  </tr>
				 </tbody>
				</table>
				
			</div>
			
			<p>It is interesting how different companies, even company divisions, have different needs and therefore, different uses of inventories.</p>
