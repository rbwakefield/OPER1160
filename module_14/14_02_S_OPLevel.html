The process brings together all the plans for the business (sales, marketing, development, manufacturing, sourcing, and financial) into one integrated set of plans. It is performed at least once a month and is reviewed by management at an aggregate (product family) level.”</em> <strong>(APICS Dictionary – 14th ed. Pg. 154)</strong></p>

			<p>Let’s look at all the functional roles that play a part in the S&OP process.  Figure 1 shows the various departments and the kind of data or information each one brings to the table.</p>

				<h4 class="text-core-2">Marketing/Sales</h4> 
				<p>They are responsible for the demand side from the customer.  They are the voice of the customer.  The forecast is the cornerstone of S&OP and it must be accurate.  If too high, we build up inventory; if too low, the result is a stock-out.</p>
				<h4 class="text-core-2">Accounting/Finance </h4>
				<p>They are responsible for the financial viability of the company.  Cost information is required for detailed budgets and cash flow projections.  They perform payback analysis on capital acquisitions.</p>
				<h4 class="text-core-2">Operations</h4>
				<p>They are responsible for the supply side of S&OP.  They use the forecast provided by Marketing to determine how to satisfy the customer.  Their plans need to consider cost, customer service, inventory investment, people, and asset utilization.</p>
				<h4 class="text-core-2">Engineering </h4>
				<p>Engineering looks at improvements/changes to product and process design.  They require information from Marketing about possible future products or services.</p>
				<h4 class="text-core-2">Purchasing </h4>
				<p>They are responsible for acquiring component or raw materials for a company.  They also bring information in regards to current suppliers’ capabilities, possible new suppliers and improvements to supplier processes or materials.</p>

						<p>Each functional area is responsible for inputting their updated information into a shared system prior to holding their monthly meeting. If you put all these people in a room for the monthly meeting to come up with a tactical plan aligned with the business plan to meet customer expectations, do you think they will all agree? Will all of them show up every month? To accomplish these goals it is critical to have upper management involvement (make the participants attend) and a decision maker present at each meeting. </p>
				
						<p>At this point, <strong>Resource Requirement Planning (RRP)</strong> is critical.  Not only do they have to agree as to what they want to produce but it must also be checked against the projected capacity for our key resources (labour, inventory, logistics). Lock the door and no one leaves until they agree on an aligned plan that works for everyone. When this process is successful, the results can be amazing.</p>
