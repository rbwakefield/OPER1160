			<p class="lead">At the S&OP level, companies will need to decide if they want to carry inventory and produce the same amount each day with little or no overtime OR will they chase the demand and produce what is needed when it is needed.</p>
			
			<p>Let’s look at both of these strategies.</p>
			
			<h3 class="text-core-4">Level Production</h3>

			<p>In this strategy production is held constant while inventory varies. You want to keep your resource level steady (labour, machines, materials) as you might have highly skilled employees or expensive equipment that should not sit idle. Employees are usually happy if they have about the same amount of work each week and do not have to worry about layoffs. You may also want to protect those employees because of their training. There are significant costs associated with layoffs, hiring and training which you can eliminate with level production. Happy workers result in satisfied customers. The negative side is that you will have varying inventory levels and the associated carrying costs (Unit # 7). Figure 5 in the <a href="documents/Business_Planning_Process_Custom_Chapter.pdf" target="_blank">Custom Chapter <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> (<em>Lopers, T., 2009, p. 9</em>) is an example of a level production planning spreadsheet including cost information.</p>

				</div>
			
			<p>This planning strategy chases or matches production levels to the sales forecast. As you build no inventory, you have to produce on demand as in most service industries. We will look at options for service industries in the next section. The Chase strategy works well when you can afford to have idle equipment, your labour is easily trained, and comes from a large labour pool (agency). At least inventory can be set and maintained at a predetermined level. Figure 7 in the <a href="documents/Business_Planning_Process_Custom_Chapter.pdf" target="_blank">Custom Chapter <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> (<em>Lopers, T., 2009, p. 12</em>) is an example of a chase production planning spreadsheet including cost information.</p>

			<h4 class="text-core-2">What are some examples of businesses that use a chase strategy?</h4>
			
			<dl class="row">
			  <dt class="col-sm-3">College bookstore </dt>
			  <dd class="col-sm-9">longer hours and extra staff first week of semester</dd>
			
			  <dt class="col-sm-3">UPS </dt>
			  <dd class="col-sm-9">hires many thousands of workers for peak seasons</dd>
			
			  <dt class="col-sm-3">Farmers </dt>
			  <dd class="col-sm-9">planting and harvesting are weather sensitive and cannot wait</dd>
			
			  <dt class="col-sm-3">Post office </dt>
			  <dd class="col-sm-9">brings in workers for each shift from an agency based on volume to be processed</dd>
			</dl>

			<h3 class="text-core-4">Mixed Production</h3>

			<p>Most common in business is a combination of Level and Chase. The problem is that it takes a few tries to come up with an optimum plan. Then, when the inputs change the next month, the team has to start all over again. However, it does usually result in the lowest overall cost.  Figures 8 & 9 in the <a href="documents/Business_Planning_Process_Custom_Chapter.pdf" target="_blank">Custom Chapter <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> (<em>Lopers, T., 2009, p. 13-14</em>) show an example of a level production planning spreadsheet including cost information.</p>
