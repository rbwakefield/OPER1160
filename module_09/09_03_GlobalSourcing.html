			<p class="lead">“Firms do not compete only against global competitors but against their competitors’ supply chains.</p>
			
			<p>Companies that were once content to purchase services and goods from local suppliers now seek to build relationships with world-class suppliers, regardless of their location.  Managers have come to realize that to compete globally, companies need to source globally” <em>(Lopers et al., 2016, p. 119)</em>.</p>
			
			<p>Think of the possibilities today due to advances in information systems.  Information, blueprints, ordering systems, tracking of shipments to time delivery, labelling of deliveries to facilitate cross-docking are just to mention a few things a global supply chain can now do efficiently and effectively.</p>
			
			<p>These changes can apply to services and business processes too, not just manufactured goods.  For instance, the call centres, IT processing, marketing, invoice processing, and many more processes do not have to be located within the walls of a company—not even in the same country.  Instead, they can be outsourced and located in lower-cost centres around the world.  As we saw in the previous units, global sourcing of goods and services goes beyond low cost.  Remember how companies expanded globally to also do business in potential markets, tap into skills or resources in other countries, etc? Yes, there are disadvantages like longer lead times or the risk of supply chain interruptions but companies are now aiming to exploit global efficiencies to deliver their products and services.</p>

			<h3 class="text-core-4">Financial Impacts of Supply Management Activities</h3>

			<p>If you look at the financial statements of a manufacturing organization typically you will find that the Cost of Materials (COGS) is almost 60% of the value of shipments.  This is illustrated in Table 5.1 on page 120 of your text (Lopers et al., 2016, p. 120). With this large expense, it shows just how important it is to make good sourcing decisions and keep the cost as low as possible to allow a company to be profitable.</p>

			<h3 class="text-core-4">Profit Leverage Effect</h3>
			
			<p>This describes the effect of $1 in cost savings that increases pretax profits by $1…”a $1 saved is a $1 earned.”  Purchasing savings for the COGS goes straight to the bottom line of profit.</p> 
			
			<p>However, a $1 increase in sales only increases pretax profits by <strong>$1 multiplied by the pretax profit margin</strong>. Pretax profit margin = [(profit/sales) x 100%]</p> 
			
			<p>What if you would like to know how many extra sales you need to also make an extra $1 of profit? <strong>Divide the $1 profit increase by the pretax profit margin</strong>.  This is the Profit Leverage Effect.  It shows that a large increase in sales is needed to equal the profits generated with the relatively small decrease in COGS obtained by purchasing well.</p>

						<p>Purchased goods and services can have a major effect on other performance dimensions including quality and delivery performance.  If there is a problem with a product or service, it can interrupt manufacturing, cause rework, scrap, delivery delays, or warranty issues. This can cause delays, internal and external costs and loss of customer satisfaction.  There is a great example in your text showing the impact of values in <strong>Example 5.2</strong> <em>(Lopers et al., 2016, p. 122).</em></p>
