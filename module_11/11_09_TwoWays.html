			<h2 class="text-core-3">Two Ways to Measure Logistics Performance</h2>

			<p class="lead">To be profitable, companies need to minimize costs and ensure customers are satisfied.</p>
			
			<p>Here are two different measurements of logistics performance.</p>
			
			<div class="col cyan lighten-5 rounded p-3 z-depth-1-half">
				<h3 class="text-core-4">Perfect Order</h3>
				
				<p>A <strong>Perfect Order</strong> is one that is delivered to a customer in a way that meets a company’s criteria.  Things like being delivered on-time, in good condition, and billed properly might be important.  To measure the percentage of orders that are perfect, you calculate the number of orders that reach customers with all criteria met.  If more than one thing is wrong, that only counts as one as we look at orders completed not the total number of mistakes.  This is a great tool to measure continuous improvement efforts linked to customer satisfaction and the logistics strategy.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Percentage of perfect orders = (total orders – orders with 1 or more defects / total orders) x 100%</strong></p>

			<h4>Example:</h4>
			
			<p>Last year, Hill Orchards reported the following statistics on their order deliveries of pies to their customers.</p>
			
			<ul class="fa-ul checklist">
				<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> 5,000 orders were processed</li>
				<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> 100 orders delivered late</li>
				<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> 350 orders were incomplete (backorders or short-shipments)</li>
				<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> 450 orders had damage</li>
				<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> 100 orders were billed incorrectly</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>These 1,000 errors were spread across 750 orders.</p>  
			
			<p><strong>Calculate the % of Perfect Orders</strong></p>
			
			<p><strong>% of Perfect Orders = (5,000 – 750)/5,000 ) x 100%  = 85% <span class="ml-5">85% were Perfect Orders</span></strong></p>
			
			<p class="text-secondary">(remember this performance measure looks at the number of orders with one or more errors NOT the number of errors)</p>

			</div>
			
			<div class="clearfix"></div>

			<div class="col orange lighten-4 rounded mt-4 mb-4 p-3 z-depth-1-half">
				<h3 class="text-core-4">Landed Cost</h3>
				
				<p>Another measure used is the total <strong>Landed Cost</strong>.  It would include the cost of the product plus all the logistical costs such as, transportation, warehousing, handling, customs duty, broker’s fees, etc.</p>
				

			</div>
			
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			
			<h4 class="text-core-2">Reverse Logistics Systems</h4>
			
			<p>More and more we are seeing the strategy of “Try Before You Buy”.  And not everyone will buy.  Instead, they will choose to return the product.  Returns or the reverse flow of items back to a company is illustrated in Figure x and shows it could be for a number of different reasons.</p>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">

					<p class="small text-secondary mt-2">Figure 1. The forward and reverse logistics flow of materials. Taken from Cerasis, 2017.</p>
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>A logistical strategy to accept returns from downstream retailers or customers, is then needed to support the overall business strategy. Some of the <strong>challenges</strong> of Reverse Logistics are:</p>

			<ul class="fa-ul checklist">
				<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Companies can’t predict or control when customers send items back, the transportation mode used, what packaging is done or what paperwork is completed</li>
				<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Items flow back for a number of reasons and it is difficult to sort and handle the goods especially when the reason for the return is not clearly documented</li>
				<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i> Often the forward logistics system is not set-up to accept goods flowing back to the company so costs might be higher as its often better to set up a whole different system</li>
			</ul>
