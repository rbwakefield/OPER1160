							<p>Cycle Time is the time required to complete a process.  Think back to the previous process map.  Pretend you have just completed your shopping at your local supermarket and you’re ready to check out.  Take 30 seconds and jot down all the reasons your cycle time (from arrival to departure from the cashier) might be increased.</p>
							
							<p>Did you get some of the following factors that increase cycle times?</p>
							
							<ul class="fa-ul checklist">
								<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Waiting times – in line, waiting on the debit machine, waiting for a price check</li>
								<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Unneeded process steps – maybe you were asked for your postal code or to donate to a charity.  Maybe they had to call for a price check</li>
								<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Sequential vs parallel processes was used – was the scanning and bagging done at the same time or was everything scanned then packed? </li>
								<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Repeated steps – that wrinkled or worse yet, missing, barcode couldn’t be read the first time.</li>
								<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Lack of information or effective training – the cashier didn’t know the code for an item, or that it was on sale or a procedure to process a coupon, discount or special</li>
								<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Outdated technology – the debit machine takes forever to process or the tape runs out when printing the receipt</li>
								<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-caret-right"></i>Excessive controls – a price override is needed but the cashier is not empowered to make the adjustment—it requires a supervisor override.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>This exercise shows some of the reasons cycle time can be affected.  When working with TQM it is important to put in processes, training and equipment to make sure the customer is satisfied and to measure cycle times and effectiveness.</p>  
							
							<p>However, a couple of words of caution.  Generally, we want processes to be efficient (meet or exceed the standard), but don’t forget from the last chapter that TQM is also harder to measure for a service.  Maybe we want the cashier to greet us and chat.  Maybe we want them to check to see if we want items double-bagged. Maybe we don’t want to be rushed to the point we feel uncomfortable and harried.</p>  
							
							<p>Quality and Efficiency is good but remember it is through the eyes of the beholder (customer). We should be also measuring Customer Satisfaction not just productivity or efficiency.</p>
