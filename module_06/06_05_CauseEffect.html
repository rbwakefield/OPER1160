			<p class="lead">The next step to tackle the quality issue for our fictitious fast food delivery company is to uncover the many causes of the problem (effect).</p>
			
			<p>We identified temperature as the main issue (effect) to tackle.  Now we can use a Cause-and-Effect Diagram also called a Fishbone or Ishikawa diagram to brainstorm the many possible causes for the identified issue—temperature.</p>   
			
			<p>See the following diagram for our example. The “head” is the box that outlines the noted effect or problem.  Then, a horizontal line is drawn running to it.  The four “fins” or lines branching off of this centre line (spine) are labelled to help sort out the causes.  Although there are various category titles, we’ll use the 4Ms.</p>  
			
			<ol>
				<li>Methods</li>
				<li>Materials</li>
				<li>Manpower</li>
				<li>Machinery </li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Other resources add either or both of Measurement and Management for 5Ms or 6 Ms.</p>  
			
			<p>To add the causes, ask “Why does this happen?” and as each cause or reason is given, write it on a branch in the appropriate cause category. This one is just started.  Could you add more causes?</p>

			<p>A company we know had a large white board placed prominently outside the cafeteria.  Each week, a different problem or effect would be added to the fishbone diagram.  Post-it notes and pens were put nearby and employees from all departments were encouraged to add their ideas as to the causes of the problem.  These were taken back to a meeting where teams were encouraged to examine these ideas to help them generate what was causing the problem…the root problem.</p>
