      "Answer": "<p>It is important to consider the customers early in the development process because that is who is ultimately going to decide if the good is a success and buy it.  You want to meet as many of the customers’ needs as possible with the good so you need to know what they want when you make it.  If you do not find these needs early and incorporate them into the initial design then you risk having to change design and functionality later at a huge cost.</p>",
