			<p class="lead">Many different organizations provide quality standards often targeted to different industries or professions.</p>
			
			<p>For instance, <a href="https://accreditation.ca/" target="_blank">Accreditation Canada <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> does this for health care and social service organizations.</p>
			
			<h3 class="text-core-4">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</h3>
			
			<p>A common one you’ll see is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  It is an independent, non-governmental international organization with over 165 countries represented. In Canada, the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/" target="_blank">Standards Council of Canada (SCC, 2017) <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>, a crown corporation, is the ISO representative.</p>

					<p>ISO is recognized world over as the international standards that support innovation and progress. ISO set standards to, as they put it, “make things work”. (iso.org, 2017)  They set world-class specifications for products, services and systems, to ensure quality, safety, and efficiency which helps facilitates world-trade. <strong>Watch this YouTube video</strong> which explains ISO Standards.</p>

		<p>The best known is the <strong>ISO 9000</strong> family of standards that sets out the requirements for a quality management system.  Notice it does not specify what a quality product or service is. Instead, it requires organizations to define the objectives and continually improve their processes to reach it. <em>(International Organization for Standardization [ISO], 2017)</em></p>

		<p>The <strong>ISO 14000</strong> series helps set the standards for companies to manage their environmental responsibilities. These would cover things like water usage, or waste disposal.</p>
		
		<p>An example of a standard set for a particular industry is <strong>ISO/TS 16949</strong> meant to see continual improvement, emphasize defect prevention and reduce variation and waste throughout the international automotive supply chain. (Note:  TS stands for Technical specifications).</p>
		
		<p>ISO certification is a detailed process and companies are, and should be, proud of it. Look around. You’ll often see it on banners or signs on the outside of companies, as logos on fleet vehicles, signs in front lobbies or with awards/trophies and on brochures, pamphlets and letterhead. <strong>Here are some examples</strong> from the Kitchener-Waterloo area.</p>

		<h3 class="text-core-4">Lean Philosophy of Continuous Improvement</h3>
		
		<p>This concept focuses on quality with a main thrust to eliminate defects and waste.  It aims to eliminate costs that are of no value to the customers.  Lean Philosophy means trying continuously improve to produce with less of everything to better satisfy the customer and increase profitability. For instance, pursuing lean would mean using less human effort, less space, less investment in tools, or less waiting or delays.  In more advanced Operations courses you’ll examine continuous improvement tools like Value Stream Mapping and Root Cause Analysis.  For now, we’re going to concentrate on the concept of Total Quality Management (TQM) and its tools, like continuous improvement. Lean combined with Total Quality Management is a strong combination! <em>(Lean Enterprise Institute, 2017)</em></p>
