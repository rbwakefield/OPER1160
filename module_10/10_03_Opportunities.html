Combined with better inventory visibility by using accurate pull data, overall supply chain inventory is reduced as well as the response time to changing customer ordering patterns. (cost reduction and responsiveness strategies from Unit # 2). This reduces surprises in the supply chain.</p>

			<p>A good example is a Canadian company that some of you might have heard of – Tim Horton’s. To gain control over their suppliers they <strong>Backward Integrated</strong> by buying the source of their baked goods (Bakerite Foods later bought by Maple Leaf Foods). To reduce variation in their delivery schedules, they <strong>Forward Integrated</strong> by building a distribution Centre and added a truck fleet in Guelph ON to serve eastern Canada. They now have control over supply, retail and distribution to better serve their customers. One of the reasons why Burger King bought Tim Horton’s was to use their efficient and effective Canadian Distribution network. The following diagram shows this backward and forward vertical integration.</p>
