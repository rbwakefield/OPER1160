			<p class="lead">A few trends are evident in looking at supply management’s future.</p>

			<p>First, Sustainable Supply means companies are becoming more focused on buying and procuring environmentally friendly or sustainable goods and services. This might mean working with suppliers that use recycled goods, support their workers, or reducing their packaging or producing their own power—all things that are good for the environment and working conditions. For instance, the <a href="http://about.hm.com/en/sustainability.html" target="_blank">H&M Group <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> follows ethical and sustainable practices in sourcing of its production and sales of goods. (<em>H&M, n.d.</em>)</p>
			
			<p>A second trend is firms are becoming more cognizant of the possibility of Disruptions in the Supply Chain and work hard to avoid possible problems often with new technology.  Storms, pirates, terrorism incidents, accidents are all disruptions and with supply chains now reaching across the globe, the chances of any interruptions or hiccups grows! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq1PL1eo4ZU" target="_blank">Look at this video <i class="fa fa-play-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> from the University of Bath discussing “how companies can control disruptions, monitor them and respond to them better.”</p>
			
			<p>Some companies are replacing their <strong>offshoring</strong> (company owns operations but locates it in another country to take advantage of cost-reductions etc) with <strong>near-shoring</strong> (company owns the operations but re-locate closer to home) which makes the transfer of information, product or goods easier to manage. Whirlpool has nearshored production of washers and dryers for North America back to North America from China. Apple is spending over $ 1B to create their first manufacturing facility in the US. Under Armour is building a design and manufacturing centre for the American market near Baltimore, the location of their head office The list could go on and on.</p>
						
			<p>Many American companies also <strong>outsource</strong> (let another company operate the business) or <strong>nearshore</strong> to Canadian companies, or to other (usually cheaper) states, maybe, due to the lower exchange rate, lower wages paid, or reduced transportation time rather than across the oceans or world.</p>
			
			<p>As technology continues to advance, information systems will continue to <strong>automate</strong> removing more of the routine purchasing activities and changing how sourcing is completed.  Activities like producing or approving purchase orders, ordering the product or service, receiving and matching the invoice with the packing slips or paying the bill electronically are all examples of areas being automated (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement_software" target="_blank">Procurement software, 2017 <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>)</p>
